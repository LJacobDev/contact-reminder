# General point of this repo

rapidly use whatever I can remember about vue without looking it up first,

to make a front end only / localstorage json database styled app about keeping
in contact with people.

It uses local storage so that it can be run off something like github pages
or locally without needing to contact a back end anywhere

# Overview of design

main page shows a set of 3 main buttons in a row at the top like a navbar

    - add new contact

    - add new interaction

    - show contacts


    - either have a 'show interactions' button or else make that list view of
    them be the default that is shown whenever 'add new contact, interaction'
    or 'show contacts' is closed out

then there can be a component below that uses the fade in/out conditional component rendering that shows either:

    - an add new contact form

    - an edit existing contact form (can be add same as new one if I make it that way)

    - a component that is a list of contacts, where clicking on one gives you the edit contact form

    - a component that allows adding a new interaction, which will also be the one to edit an interaction

    (adding new will create the interaction, and bring to edit view. edit view will have save and delete buttons)

    - a component that is a grid of interactions

    - the interactions have date, contact, summary of thing done,
        summary of next thing to do, date to do next thing at, viewable from the list

      then you can sort them by date done, but the usual order will be sorted by date to do next thing at

    probably a combo box or something to select whether to sort by date done or date to do next thing at

    - make a thing that either shows all, or I guess has some kind of pagination that only shows (selectable per page of 10, 20, 50, all)

- interactions should be able to be shown as a list of rows in general, but also,
- there should not only be a 'view contact details' component / view, there should also be a list shown of interaction history for that contact
- this contact's interaction history might be a separate page or something that can be hid/shown underneath contact details,
- possibly include two ways of showing it, as a list of rows with dates and brief titles to click on for details,
- and maybe as well a way to show rows of the interactions but where the full textarea of all the information is also shown to scroll through rather than having to click on each one

I think I'd rather use vue router than the hide/show conditional rendering, so that it is more like going to different pages.. however, even that is something that can happen within a div kind of component and the navbar at the top can still stay the same..

    it's just that I'm not sure whether it merits having other 'url links' to go to the different things but I imagine it actually should so yes I want to use the vue router for this

# Things to remember

This application doesn't use login authentication,
it saves and retrieves from browser localstorage
so it is not recommended to store sensitive data in this

I'm adding vue router and want to use it for /contacts,
/interactions, /contacts/edit and that kind of thing

I'm adding 'Vitest' unit testing and I want to make use of it

    ('npm run test:unit' has it running vitest in a kind of watch mode currently)

I normally use tailwindcss but want to get practice at using conventional css for this

I was going to delete all the original scaffolding files and folders generated by Vite,
but I am finding them useful to look at as references for how to organize this app,
so I'm leaving some of them around intentionally as reminders and references

In the scaffolding files, a link to [https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue) was mentioned
and it should be very helpful to look at so many other examples of Vue projects
to gain expertise sooner

# Things to do next

quickly put together an 'interaction' view which I can use to help me work out which fields I want it to have

.. fix the interaction-details input elements in the InteractionItem component to not overflow their flex container
.. I just changed the router-view to have width:100% instead of width:80% and it essentially solved the issue but I still want to understand why there was an overflow back when width was at 80%

.. remove wherever the css styling is that made "Show Interactions" routerlink get green text

I feel like the /interaction route will want to have an interactionID as a get parameter that it uses to fetch a given interaction from localstorage or whatever data structure might be holding it in memory if any

the interaction date and time should default to the date.now when it is created, but with the option for the user to change it

I might sitll want a 'date created' separate field that isn't changeable so that there is some way to know when things were really entered, but I don't know how important that really is

create useContacts.ts and useInteractions.ts composable, or possibly combine both into one file

    create contact and interaction types or interfaces

Make initial data stucture for how contacts and interactions will be saved and related to each other

    each contact and each interaction will have a unique ID, probably a UUID type number

    they will be saved in localstorage individually where the localstorage key is the ID number

    then there will also be a 'list of contacts' that is just an array of the contact IDs stored as an item in localstorage

    so the list of contacts can be retrieved and then localstorage can be queried by these IDs to get data about any given contact

    each contact field will then have an array of interaction IDs related to it to retrieve those

    but there will also be a separate main array of all interaction ids as well so that all can be viewed in rows

    each interaction also has a reference to the contact it relates to



    create 'create, load/retrieve, save/update, and delete' functions

    create unit tests for all these CRUD operation functions


    create contact object data structure and its fields

        name
        type (friend, work colleague, make a custom list of contact types that the user can define)
        maybe lastContactDateTime, nextContactDateTime (or lastContactDate, lastContactTime... separately?)
        (or probably  lastcontactdate will just be stored in interaction as its own date, and nextcontactdate can be an interaction's 'next contact date')
        phone number
        email
        website
        address

    create a data object that can store list of custom contact types / interaction types that gets
    loaded and filled into the combo box selections on future use

    create interaction and its fields

    give each contact a unique id

    give each interaction a unique id

    let the contact have a collection of interaction ids that it relates to
    rather than having it store the actual interaction data in its collection

    the interaction should also have a reference of what contact ID it relates to

get something in either a console.log() or in a rendered view that can show a basic 'contact' and 'interaction' object data and whether it's able to be saved and loaded to/from localstorage before going further with making forms and layouts

Get buttons to work (add, edit, save, delete for both contacts and interactions)

come back again to add more styling polish to elements once the layout and component structure is more settled

tidy up dev_notes.md to have better appearance when viewing on github

# Things done so far

    initial project directory created

    dev_notes.md created

    Before deleting the Vite generated scaffolding, took a moment to fully examine each file and folder.
    This was highly informative about how a Vue project's structure can be organized.  This time, rather than
    erasing everything and  making everything from memory, it is helpful to see the structure already laid out
    and to fill in with this particular app's contents next.

    Took more time to fully break down a complete understanding of every line of every component and main file,
    and tinkered with things.  Tried running npx serve in order to test the 'README.md' link in TheWelcome between
    running in a Vite dev server and running dist in a non-dev server to see the different behaviours.  Clicking
    the link while running dev server opens the readme in the IDE, where the non-dev server returns a 404 on that link.


    Took a moment to explore the different effects of using:

    "More instructions are available in <a href="/__open-in-editor?file=README.md"><code>README.md</code></a>."

    versus the original of:

    "More instructions are available in <a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="openReadmeInEditor"><code>README.md</code></a>."


    Make initial placeholder type main view component

    add enough styling to make it functional and roughly placed in 'nice enough to develop with' looking layout
